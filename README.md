# SDF YANG conversion examples

This repository contains example conversion results for the mapping proposed in [draft-kiesewalter-asdf-yang-sdf-00](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kiesewalter-asdf-yang-sdf-00.html). They have been generated with the associated converter tool. If you want to try the converter tool yourself you can use the [demo website](http://sdf-yang-converter.org/) or install the [command line tool](https://github.com/jkiesewalter/sdf-yang-converter) on your own machine.

`sdf2yang` contains the SDF models `sdfobject-alarm.sdf.json` and `sdfobject-batterymaterial.sdf.json`and their respective conversions to YANG modules.

`yang2sdf` contains the YANG modules `ietf-access-control-list.yang` in revision 2019-03-04 and `ietf-system.yang` in revsision 2014-08-06 as well as the SDF versions of these models.
